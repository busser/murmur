## ðŸ”¥ Public Go API Available

Murmur's internals are now publicly accessible for Go library usage! All packages have been moved from `internal/` to `pkg/`, enabling other Go programs to import and use Murmur's components directly:

```go
import "github.com/busser/murmur/pkg/murmur"

// Use the provider system directly
providers := murmur.ProviderFactories
awsProvider, _ := providers["awssm"]()

// Access the secret resolution pipeline
secrets := map[string]string{
    "DB_PASSWORD": "awssm:my-database-secret",
}
resolved, _ := murmur.ResolveAll(secrets)
```

This enables powerful use cases like:
- **Configuration-based secret resolution** instead of environment variables
- **Custom secret injection workflows** in Go applications  
- **Testing with mock providers** for unit tests
- **Building custom secret management tools** on top of Murmur's provider system

All providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Scaleway), filters (JSONPath), and core resolution logic are now available for library usage.

## ðŸ“š Enhanced release process

Major improvements to Murmur's release tooling and documentation:

- **Structured release notes** - Organized release notes in `docs/release-notes/`
- **GoReleaser v2** - Updated configuration for modern release tooling  
- **Release automation** - New `make release` and `make release-dry-run` targets
- **Comprehensive documentation** - Detailed release process in CLAUDE.md

This establishes a robust foundation for future Murmur releases with better organization and automation.

## ðŸ”§ Community contributions

Special thanks to @christianking-gitlab for identifying the need for library usage and contributing the initial implementation approach. This release addresses that need comprehensively while providing maximum flexibility for Go developers.
